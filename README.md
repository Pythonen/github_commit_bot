# Github-Telegram-bot
Telegram bot that sends you screenshot of the green wall of commits. It can be found in Telegram **@github_commits_bot**.

Note that the bot is running on free Heroku Dyno and it needs to wake up if it has been over 30 mins inactive and hence it might be a bit slow at first.

Master (main) is pushed straight to Heroku.
